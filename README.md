# Task: Responsive page with popup

## Technologies Used

### - **Frontend Framework - React JS**
    - I used this framework because, first its easy to use when there is a repetitive component, then its for the mobile part wherein you tapped then logos to show their details react's useState is great for this kind of functions, also in countdown in popup, I used react's hooks for it to function without the need to re-render the page every second. 

### - **CSS Framework - Tailwindcss**
    - I am used to using tailwind because you can troubleshoot and adjust items faster also i sucked at naming classes 

### - **Icons - react-icons library**
    - using this library because it compiled all the free icons in the net from font awesome to bootstrap icons
